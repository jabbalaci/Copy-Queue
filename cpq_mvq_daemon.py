"""
Daemon for the cpq and mvq commands.

It is not running all the time. cpq and mvq will start it
if it's not running. It will run as long as there are tasks.
When all tasks are done, the daemon stops.
Since tasks are added by cpq/mvq, the daemon will be started
by those commands if necessary.
Only one instance of the daemon may run, it is achieved via
a lock file.
